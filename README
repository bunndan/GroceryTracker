Grocery Tracker

This is a simple web based grocery list tool that allows a user to track a list of grocery items they would like to purchase. 

The main focus here was to allow a person to add and remove items in a list. Some goals I wanted to hit were:

1. Add item to list
2. Grocery item - display a title and notes (optional)
3. View list of items
4. Show all items on screen
5. Title shown only on fullscreen
6. View details of item
7. Remove an item from list
8. Have delete button when showing item
9. Confirmation dialogue
10. Edit an item in list
11. Have edit button when showing item
12. Confirmation to save or cancel changes
13. Mark item on list as purchased
14. Toggle box per item
15. Purchased item shown differently

I was able to see how much I could do within 3 hours.
